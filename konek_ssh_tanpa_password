If you've done it before but forgot, here's the refresher. (Otherwise, read below.)

On server:

cd .ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa  (hit return through prompts)
cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
chmod 600 authorized_keys
rm id_rsa.pub

On client:

cd .ssh
scp myserver.com:.ssh/id_rsa myserver.rsa
chmod 600 myserver.rsa
echo "Host myserver" >> config
echo "Hostname reblets.com" >> config
echo "IdentityFile ~/.ssh/myserver.rsa" >> config

Test it:

scp file myserver:.
ssh myserver
